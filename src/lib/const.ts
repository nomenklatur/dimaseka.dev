My name is Dimas Eka Putra. I was born in 2000. I am a full-stack software engineer who can develop both back-end and front-end applications. For back-end engineering, my favourite stacks are Typescript, PHP, and Go. For front-end engineering, I usually use Vue or React JS for web development and Flutter for mobile app development. I like developing complex systems and apps. I like to study how big apps work, how they set up their systems and how they make a profit from it. I am open if there is an opportunity to develop apps for people. My fare starts from IDR 500000 to IDR 2000000 (excluding server price and domain price). To develop the apps, I need to know what platform will be used ( is it Web, Android, or Ios)

My hobbies are playing video games and watching movies. My favourite games are the Assassin's Creed series, and my favourite movies are the Harry Potter series and the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.

I majored in computer science with a 3.84 GPA from Universitas Sumatera Utara. I graduated in 2022. I was a teaching assistant during my college years. I taught Object Oriented Programming, Web Development, and even robotics. I am also willing to teach people how to develop apps.

I am currently single. I am a straight male. As a software engineer, I donâ€™t have much time to socialize with other people which I thought might be part of the reason as to why I am still single.
